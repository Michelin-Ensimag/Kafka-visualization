## Reporting a Vulnerability

We strongly encourage you to report potential security vulnerabilities to one of our contributors mail, before disclosing them in a public forum.

Please send one plain-text, unencrypted, email for each vulnerability you are reporting. You can also send an image, movie, HTML, or PDF attachment.

If we don't responde fast enough for you open an issue.

HOWEVER our code mainly use Excalidraw (https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/)[https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/] and you may have to tell them something about it.
